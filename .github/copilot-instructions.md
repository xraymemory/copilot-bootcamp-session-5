# Project Instructions

## Project Context
- Full-stack TODO application with React frontend and Express backend
- Focus on iterative, feedback-driven development
- Current phase: Backend stabilization and frontend feature completion

## Documentation References
- [docs/project-overview.md](../docs/project-overview.md) - Architecture, tech stack, and structure
- [docs/testing-guidelines.md](../docs/testing-guidelines.md) - Test patterns and standards
- [docs/workflow-patterns.md](../docs/workflow-patterns.md) - Development workflow guidance

## Development Principles
- **Test-Driven Development**: Red-Green-Refactor cycle
- **Incremental Changes**: Small, testable modifications
- **Systematic Debugging**: Use test failures as guides
- **Validation Before Commit**: All tests pass, no lint errors

## Testing Scope
This project uses unit tests and integration tests ONLY:
- Backend: Jest + Supertest for API testing
- Frontend: React Testing Library for component unit/integration tests
- Manual browser testing for full UI verification
- DO NOT suggest or implement e2e test frameworks (Playwright, Cypress, Selenium)
- DO NOT suggest browser automation tools
- Reason: Keep lab focused on unit/integration tests without e2e complexity

**Testing Approach by Context**:
- Backend API changes: Write Jest tests FIRST, then implement (RED-GREEN-REFACTOR)
- Frontend component features: Write React Testing Library tests FIRST for component behavior, then implement (RED-GREEN-REFACTOR). Follow with manual browser testing for full UI flows.
- This is true TDD: Test first, then code to pass the test

## Workflow Patterns
1. **TDD Workflow**: Write/fix tests → Run → Fail → Implement → Pass → Refactor
2. **Code Quality Workflow**: Run lint → Categorize issues → Fix systematically → Re-validate
3. **Integration Workflow**: Identify issue → Debug → Test → Fix → Verify end-to-end

## Agent Usage
- **tdd-developer**: For test-related work and Red-Green-Refactor cycles
- **code-reviewer**: For addressing lint errors and code quality improvements

## Memory System
- **Persistent Memory**: This file (`.github/copilot-instructions.md`) contains foundational principles and workflows
- **Working Memory**: `.github/memory/` directory contains discoveries and patterns
- During active development, take notes in `.github/memory/scratch/working-notes.md` (not committed)
- At end of session, summarize key findings into `.github/memory/session-notes.md` (committed)
- Document recurring code patterns in `.github/memory/patterns-discovered.md` (committed)
- Reference these files when providing context-aware suggestions

## Workflow Utilities
GitHub CLI commands for workflow automation (available to all modes):
- List open issues: `gh issue list --state open`
- Get issue details: `gh issue view <issue-number>`
- Get issue with comments: `gh issue view <issue-number> --comments`
- The main exercise issue will have "Exercise:" in the title
- Steps are posted as comments on the main issue
- Use these commands when `/execute-step` or `/validate-step` prompts are invoked

## Git Workflow
- Use conventional commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `docs:`, etc.
- Feature branches: `feature/<descriptive-name>`
- Always stage all changes before committing: `git add .`
- Push to the correct branch: `git push origin <branch-name>`
